Cao Pi "A discourse on Literature" 

First essay devoted to the discussion of Literature.
The time period is 187-126 AD. It discusses the idea of reputation and talent
when obtaining literary abiltiies. 
We see our first idiom here, "A worn-out broom is worth more than a thousand pieces of gold, 
as ong as it belongs to me" 

The great literary men of the day are Kong Rong, Chen Lin, Wang Can, 
Xu Gan, Ruan Yu, Ying chang, and Liu Zhen. 

Not exactly sure what he means by a superior person measures himself 
to avoid the entanglements of envy. 

The writer goes on to evaluate the writing abilities of all the 
most influential writers of the day.
